This is a simple Google Chrome extension that keeps your Apple GSX session alive indefinitely.

By default your session will expire after a short period of inactivity. It can be burdensome to restart a lengthy repair from square one or hunt down a particular page of a service manual every time your session expires. If you work in a busy shop that fields many phonecalls and countertop support requests, this gets old very quickly. If you share these sentiments and you work in a shop with strong mutual respect and trust among your coworkers then this extension may be of interest to you.

This extension will NOT preserve your session if you have a connection interruption at the end of an idle timeout period. This includes having the machine in sleep mode. 

To install, you must enable extension developer mode, then click "Load Unpacked" and select the folder where you unzipped the files in this project.
